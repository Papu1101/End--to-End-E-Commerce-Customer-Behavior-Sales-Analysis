🔍 Key Insights

Customer churn risk is high, making retention a critical business challenge

Returning customers contribute a significantly higher share of revenue

Discounts do not meaningfully increase order value or purchase quantity

Revenue and demand are concentrated in specific cities and product categories

Delivery time alone has limited impact on customer ratings

💡 Business Recommendations

Focus on retention strategies for high churn-risk customers instead of aggressive acquisition

Prioritize high-performing cities and product categories for marketing and operations

Re-evaluate blanket discount strategies and move toward targeted, value-based promotions
